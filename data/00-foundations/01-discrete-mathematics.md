# Discrete Mathematics — Foundations of Computing

The mathematical language of computer science. Discrete math underpins algorithms, data structures, cryptography, and all of computing theory.

## Set Theory

- **Sets**: unordered collection of distinct elements; notation `{1, 2, 3}`, empty set `∅`
- **Operations**: union `A ∪ B`, intersection `A ∩ B`, difference `A \ B`, complement `Aᶜ`, symmetric difference `A Δ B`
- **Power Set**: `𝒫(S)` — set of all subsets; `|𝒫(S)| = 2ⁿ`
- **Cartesian Product**: `A × B = {(a,b) | a∈A, b∈B}`; basis for relations and tuples
- **Cardinality**: finite vs infinite; countable (ℕ, ℚ) vs uncountable (ℝ); Cantor's diagonal argument
- **ZFC Axioms**: foundation of modern set theory; avoids Russell's paradox

## Combinatorics

- **Permutations**: ordered arrangements; `P(n,k) = n!/(n-k)!`
- **Combinations**: unordered selections; `C(n,k) = n!/(k!(n-k)!)` — binomial coefficient
- **Stars and Bars**: distributing n identical items into k bins: `C(n+k-1, k-1)`
- **Pigeonhole Principle**: if n items placed in m boxes and n > m, at least one box contains ≥2 items
- **Inclusion-Exclusion**: `|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|`; generalizes to n sets
- **Recurrence Relations**: Fibonacci `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`, solving via characteristic equations
- **Generating Functions**: encode sequences as power series; closed forms for recurrences
- **Catalan Numbers**: `C_n = (1/(n+1))·C(2n,n)`; count BSTs, valid parentheses, triangulations

## Graph Theory

- **Fundamentals**: vertices (V), edges (E); directed vs undirected; simple graphs, multigraphs, hypergraphs
- **Connectivity**: paths, cycles, connected components; strongly connected (directed); articulation points and bridges
- **Eulerian Paths**: traverse every edge exactly once; exists iff 0 or 2 vertices have odd degree; Euler's theorem
- **Hamiltonian Paths**: visit every vertex exactly once; NP-complete to determine; Dirac's theorem (δ ≥ n/2)
- **Graph Coloring**: chromatic number χ(G); greedy coloring; Four Color Theorem (planar graphs need ≤4 colors)
- **Planar Graphs**: can be drawn without edge crossings; Euler's formula V - E + F = 2; Kuratowski's theorem (K₅ and K₃,₃)
- **Matching**: bipartite matching (Hopcroft-Karp); stable marriage (Gale-Shapley); Hall's marriage theorem
- **Trees**: connected acyclic graph; n nodes, n-1 edges; spanning trees; minimum spanning tree (Kruskal, Prim)

## Number Theory

- **Divisibility**: `a|b` if b = ka; gcd(a,b), lcm(a,b); Euclidean algorithm for GCD
- **Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: finds x,y such that `ax + by = gcd(a,b)`; computes modular inverses
- **Modular Arithmetic**: congruence `a ≡ b (mod m)`; residues Z/mZ; addition, multiplication, exponentiation
- **Chinese Remainder Theorem**: system of congruences with coprime moduli has unique solution modulo product
- **Euler's Totient**: φ(n) = count of integers < n coprime to n; φ(p) = p-1 for prime p
- **Fermat's Little Theorem**: `aᵖ⁻¹ ≡ 1 (mod p)` for prime p not dividing a
- **Miller-Rabin Test**: probabilistic primality testing; witnesses for compositeness
- **RSA Foundations**: trapdoor one-way function based on hardness of factoring; `c = mᵉ mod n`, `m = cᵈ mod n`

## Probability Theory

- **Fundamentals**: sample space Ω, events, probability axioms; `P(A) ∈ [0,1]`, `P(Ω)=1`, `P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A∩B)`
- **Conditional Probability**: `P(A|B) = P(A∩B)/P(B)`; independence `P(A∩B) = P(A)P(B)`
- **Bayes Theorem**: `P(A|B) = P(B|A)·P(A)/P(B)`; prior → likelihood → posterior
- **Random Variables**: discrete (Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson) vs continuous (Uniform, Normal, Exponential)
- **Expectation & Variance**: `E[X] = Σx·P(x)`, `Var(X) = E[(X-μ)²]`; linearity of expectation
- **Law of Large Numbers**: sample mean converges to expected value as n → ∞
- **Central Limit Theorem**: sum of i.i.d. random variables approaches Normal distribution
- **Markov Chains**: states, transition matrix, stationary distribution; PageRank as stationary distribution

## Boolean Algebra & Logic

- **Boolean Operators**: AND (∧), OR (∨), NOT (¬), XOR (⊕), NAND, NOR; truth tables
- **Identities**: De Morgan's laws `¬(A∧B) = ¬A ∨ ¬B`, distributive, associative, commutative, absorption
- **Karnaugh Maps**: graphical minimization of Boolean expressions; grouping adjacent 1s; don't-care conditions
- **Propositional Logic**: atomic propositions, connectives, well-formed formulas; logical equivalence; inference rules (modus ponens, modus tollens)
- **Predicate Logic**: quantifiers ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential); predicates and functions; Skolemization

## Learning Path

1. Set theory and combinatorics (counting is the foundation)
2. Graph theory and number theory
3. Probability and statistics
4. Boolean algebra and logic
